Assignment #11: 

Exercise 1: Simple Function
1.  Create a function named greet_user that takes a user's name as a parameter and prints a personalized greeting message like "Hello, [name]!".

Exercise 2: Area of a Rectangle
1.  Create a function named calculate_rectangle_area that takes the width and height of a rectangle as parameters and returns its area.
2.  Demonstrate the usage of this function by calculating the area of a rectangle with width=5 and height=8.

Exercise 3: Celsius to Fahrenheit Conversion
1.  Create a function named celsius_to_fahrenheit that takes a temperature in Celsius as a parameter and returns its equivalent temperature in Fahrenheit using the formula: Fahrenheit = (Celsius * 9/5) + 32.
2.  Demonstrate the usage of this function by converting a temperature of 25 degrees Celsius to Fahrenheit.

Exercise 4: Check Even or Odd
1.  Create a function named is_even that takes an integer as a parameter and returns True if the number is even, otherwise False.
2.  Demonstrate the usage of this function by checking whether the number 10 is even or odd.

Exercise 5: Maximum of Two Numbers
1.  Create a function named max_of_two that takes two numbers as parameters and returns the larger of the two.
2.  Demonstrate the usage of this function by finding the maximum of 32 and 78.

Exercise 6: Vowel Checker
1.  Create a function named is_vowel that takes a character (a single letter) as a parameter and returns True if it's a vowel (a, e, i, o, u - both uppercase and lowercase), otherwise False.
2.  Demonstrate the usage of this function by checking whether the characters 'a', 'b', 'E', and 'Z' are vowels.

Exercise 7: Factorial of a Number
1.  Create a function named factorial that takes a positive integer as a parameter and returns its factorial. The factorial of a non-negative integer n is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to n.
2.  Demonstrate the usage of this function by calculating the factorial of 5.

Exercise 8: Palindrome Checker
1.  Create a function named is_palindrome that takes a string as a parameter and returns True if it's a palindrome, otherwise False. A palindrome is a word, phrase, number, or other sequence of characters that reads the same forward and backward, ignoring spaces, punctuation, and capitalization.
2.  Demonstrate the usage of this function by checking whether the strings "radar" and "Python" are palindromes.

Exercise 9: Multiples Sum
1.  Create a function named sum_multiples that takes an integer n as a parameter and returns the sum of all multiples of 3 and 5 that are less than n.
2.  Demonstrate the usage of this function by calculating the sum of multiples of 3 and 5 less than 100.

Exercise 10: Print a Triangle
1.  Create a function named print_triangle that takes a positive integer n as a parameter and prints a right-angled triangle using asterisks (*) with n rows.
2.  Demonstrate the usage of this function by printing a triangle with 5 rows.
